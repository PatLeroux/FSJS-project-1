# Random-Quote-Generator-master

In this project, you'll create an app that displays random famous quotes each time a button is clicked. You will select your own quotes from famous historical figures, artists, scientists, celebrities, etc..

Example:

    "Every great developer you know got there by solving problems they were unqualified to solve until they actually did it." - Patrick McKenzie

Please select tasteful, positive and uncontroversial quotes, for the sake of this project. Thank you.

You'll use your growing knowledge of basic JavaScript syntax, variables, loops and object literals to complete this project.

To help you get started, you'll be supplied with some basic starter files, including the HTML, CSS, and a JavaScript file containing some starter code and comments. But you'll have to:

    Locate and select your own quotes
    Build the array of quote objects to store the quotes
    Write your own functions for selecting random quotes from the array and printing them to the screen.

This project is a fun and effective way for you to practice fundamental JavaScript skills while also creating a simple interactive portfolio piece to showcase your understanding of JavaScript fundamentals.

While you develop this project, you'll store and track it on GitHub, an important tool used by millions of developers across the globe to help share code and work collaboratively on programming projects. Creating and using a GitHub account is not only a basic requirement for most modern developers, it is also a great way to share your work with family, friends, and most importantly, potential employers.

After completing this project, you'll have a tremendous sense of accomplishment, an awesome example of your hard work to show off, and you'll be one important step closer to your goals. Best of luck and happy coding!

To get a passing grade you'll need to submit a project that meets the following requirements. If your project receives a "Needs Work" rating on any of these tasks, then you'll need to edit your project and re-submit it until it "Meets" or "Exceeds" each task requirement.

Create Array of Objects 	
   Array of objects is named quotes.
   Array contains at least 5 quote objects.

Quote Objects 	
   Objects in array include at least quote and source properties.
   Objects in array include additional properties, such as categorization tags.

getRandomQuote function 	
   Function is named getRandomQuote and returns a random object from the quotes array.

printQuote function 	
   Function is named printQuote
   It calls the getRandomQuote function.
   It prints the quote to the page using the appropriate format.
   Quotes change automatically after a certain amount of time passes.
   Background color changes each time the quote changes.

Code comments 	
   Comments are included in the code.

   Elements that Met Expectations

       Create Array of Objects
           Array of objects is named quotes.
           Array contains at least 5 quote objects.
       Reviewer Comments:

       Excellent work!

       I haven't seen anyone else initialise the quotes array, and fill it with quote objects in the manner you have here. I like what you've done. The way you thought ahead to getRandomQuote() is sublime.

       `getRandomQuote` function
           Function is named getRandomQuote and returns a random object from the quotes array.
       Reviewer Comments:

       I'm very impressed with how you handled getRandomQuote().

       I love your use of splice() to remove each selected quote from the array of quotes, thus making it highly unlikely that any one quote would show twice in a row.

       I certainly didn't think to handle the immediate repetition of quotes with the prowess you have, when I did this project.

       Incredibly well done!

       Code comments
           Comments are included in the code.
       Reviewer Comments:

       const yourComments = { masterful: true, clarity: "crystal", colleagueAppreciationLevel: 10 };

       Keep up the comments as you have. Your clarity lacks nothing.

       Excellent job!

   Elements that Exceeded Expectations

       Quote Objects
           Objects in array include additional properties, such as categorization tags.
       Reviewer Comments:

       You've nailed exceeds here, which wasn't a challenge for you it seems.

       You've got skill.

       Nice choice of quotes, by the way.

       `printQuote` function
           Quotes change automatically after a certain amount of time passes.
           Background color changes each time the quote changes.

       Reviewer Comments:

       "Exceeds Expectations" doesn't do justice to your code.

       You blow expectations out of the water.

       15000ms feels like just the right amount of time to ponder each quote.

       The manner in which you select a random hex colour is quite succinct and tidy.

       Incredible.

   Overall Comments

   You've done an incredible job on project 1.

   I'm sure this isn't your first go at programming.

   Keeping as much of your code in functions as you have, allows for easily visible flow during the run of the actual program, at lines 164 - 166. In more complex front-end projects, flow visibility like what you've done here is helpful to outside viewers, and your future self.

   Your future or present colleagues are going to thank you every day for you excellent documentation, and succinct code. I wish I were your student; there is much I could learn from someone with your skill.

   I have every confidence you'll continue to nail exceeds expectations throughout your Techdegree, and wish you good luck going forward.

   God Bless
